Grails bank example
===================

This is an web application meant to show use of [Grails](http://www.grails.org).  
It is suppose to be small, concrete, consistent and have a small codebase.  
I have left out any JavaScript and the CSS is only Twitter Bootstrap.  

Features
--------

* Users/roles
* Admin can create users
* Users (and admin) can create bank accounts
* Transfer money between bank accounts

Technologies beside standard Grails
-----------------------------------

Tried to keep this at a minimum.

* Spring security
* Webflow
